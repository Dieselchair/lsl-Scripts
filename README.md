A collection of lsl scritps for second life building


Linden Scripting Language, or LSL, is the programming language used by residents of Second Life (SL), a virtual world by Linden Lab and similar virtual worlds.

LSL has a syntax similar to C and allows objects to control the behavior of in-world objects of Second Life from the Internet via email, XML-RPC, and most recently, HTTP requests.
